                      unnecessary issues and goes to any extent to achieve what

                      Tarak did in Komaram Bheemudo song. Showing pain, showing
                      betrayal, showing subjugation to the motherland, but not
                      even batting an eyelid at the oppressor. Not just showing
                      all these emotions, but showing all these emotions in one
                      shot, in one frame. That is like an epic.”
